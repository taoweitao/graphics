Compilation
1)compile
make(if the Makefile breaks, please first run "premake4 gmake" then "make")
2)run
./A4 ./objective10.lua(Please make sure you are in the Project/ and put Project/ in cs488/)
3)
I run it on gl38

Manual
About the detail please see the documentation.

And there are something you need to adjust if you want to run the other .lua file.

In A4.cpp, there are different macros which are used to adjust different things.

MAXHIT: The max times which lights use to hit an object.
REFLECTION: 0 means no reflection; 1 means reflection; 2 means glossy reflection
NUM_OF_REFLECTIONS: The sample rays in glossy reflection
GLOSS: np in glossy model
REFRACTION: true means refraction; false means no refraction
ALIASE: true means aliasing; false means no aliasing
ANTI_RATIO: The smaller it is, more pixels it'll aliase (0.1 - 0.3 is a good choice in common)
NUM_OF_LIGHTS: The sample lights in soft shadow
LIGHT_DISTANCE: The distance of the sample lights from original lights in soft shadow
NUM_OF_RAYS: The sample rays in depth of field
LENS_RADIUS: The distance of the sample rays from original rays in depth of field

After changing these parameters, you can compile it again and run the .lua files.

And I also make some change about the .lua grammers.
1. When creating a new material, it needs another number which means the refractive index of the material.
2. You can use gr.cylinder('name') to create a cylinder, please make sure the the default size is: x^2 + y^2 = 1 and -1 < z < 1.
3. You can use gr.cone('name') to create a cone, please make sure the the default size is: x^2 + y^2 = z^2 and 0 < z < 1.
4. You can use gr.texture("name.png") to create a texture, please make sure .png is in Project/ .
5. You can use gr.bump("name.png") to create a bump, please make sure .png is in Project/ .
6. Please make sure every objects have their own material, even if you map a texture or bump to it. But when you add a bump, there can be no texture in it.

My objectives
1. Primitives: Cylinder and Cone --objective1.lua
2. Texuture Mapping --objective2.lua
3. Bump Mapping --objective3.lua
4. Reflection --objective4.lua
5. Refraction --objective5.lua
6. Glossy Reflection --objective6.lua
7. Adaptive Anti-aliasing --objective7.lua
8. Soft Shadow --objective8.lua
9. Depth of Field --objective9.lua
10. Final Scene --objective10.lua
Please make sure to change the macro before run .lua files except objective10.lua!!!
