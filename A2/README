Manual
I complete all requirements and there aren't new features.

At first, I put my eye on (4, 4, 4), so the two gnomons coincides with each other. And I use three different colours to distinguish the x, y and z axis.
I set near plane to 1 and far plane to 10 at first, if you want to check the clipping please change it slowly.
